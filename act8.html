                        <p>A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.

              <p>A Database Management System or DBMS is a type of software that communicates with the database itself, applications, and user interfaces to obtain data and parse it. The DBMS also contains the key instruments to govern the database.

                          <p style="text-align: justify;">A relational database is a type of data store organizing data into tables that are related to one another, which explains the name. Structured Query Language is the core of these systems as it is used to communicate with and manage these databases, having given birth to their second name â€” SQL databases. RDBMSs have a predefined schema, meaning data resides in rows (records) and columns (attributes) with a strict structure. Here, each record usually holds a value for each attribute, resulting in clear dependencies between different data points.</p>

                            <h4 style="text-align: center;">Non-relational or NoSQL Databases</h4>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">A non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems. Instead, non-relational databases use a storage model that is optimized for the specific requirements of the type of data being stored. The term NoSQL refers to data stores that do not use SQL for queries. Instead, the data stores use other programming languages and constructs to query the data. In practice, "NoSQL" means "non-relational database," even though many of these databases do support SQL-compatible queries.  </p>

Today, MySQL is a pillar of LAMP application software. That means itâ€™s a part of Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Perl/PHP/Python stack. Having C and C++ under the hood, MySQL works well with such system platforms as Windows, Linux, MacOS, IRIX, and others.</h6>

                                          <p><b>Small web-based solutions.</b>   MySQL database system is the best option when youâ€™re designing a small, web-based solution with a small volume of data. For example, when building a local eCommerce store, MySQL may come in handy.</p>
                                          <p> <b>OLAP/OLTP systems.</b>  This is one of the best use cases for a MySQL database, as OLAP/OLTP donâ€™t require complex queries and large volumes of data. Also, consider applying MySQL for the same reason if youâ€™re building a business intelligence tool.</p>

                                                  <p>Thanks to even data distribution, Cassandra is relevant in applications where large volumes of information are processed. For instance, itâ€™s a great choice for data centers. Also, Cassandra fits well with real-time analytics, as it allows linear scaling and data increase in real time. You may also consider it for applications with constant data streaming like weather apps. Another option is using it as a DBMS for an eCommerce store, as it allows for storing purchase history and other transactions. Add here feasibility to track such data types as order status and packages, and youâ€™ll get the full solution with eCommerce delivery integration.</p>

Built on the Apache Lucene library, it stores data as a JSON file, supports RESTful APIs, and uses a powerful analytical engine for faster data retrieval. Being open-source software, it includes both free and paid editions.</h6>

As far as NoSQL databases, there are two options: Firebase Realtime Database (providing real-time access to data residing in different platforms) and Cloud Firestore (offering more scalability and more complex data models). As such, both solutions fit nicely into the scenario when you need to deal with lots of data in real time: Changes for the databases are fetched as they happen. Googleâ€™s child stores data in JSON format and provides various data management offerings including a convenient data browsing tool.</h6>
